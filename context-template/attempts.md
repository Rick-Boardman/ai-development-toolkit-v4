# Attempts (Commands / Experiments)

Purpose: prevent repeating the same failing command/approach during long sessions.

Rule: before retrying, check the most recent entry and change at least one variable (command, flags, directory, environment).

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

**What I tried**:
- Command: `[exact command]`
- Working dir: `[path]`

**Result**:
- Outcome: ✅ Success | ❌ Error
- Key output/error: `[paste the key line(s)]`

**Hypothesis**:
- [why it failed / what I think is wrong]

**Next change**:
- [what I will do differently next]
