# .adt-context (Project Memory)

This directory is the committed, high-signal memory for this project.

Keep it short and current. Prefer updating these files over leaving context only in chat.

## Snapshot

- **Project goal**: [1 sentence]
- **Current focus**: [what we’re doing this week]
- **Non-goals**: [what we are explicitly not doing]
- **Constraints**: [stack/version, deadlines, policies]

## How To Work Here

- Read `now.md` before starting work.
- Check `reminders.md` for any pending reminders.
- If you hit errors, record them in `attempts.md` before retrying.
- Use `interrupt.md` as a human pause button.

## When A Session Ends

If you have to stop with work in-flight (user leaving / going to bed), write a detailed status dump in `handoff.md`.
