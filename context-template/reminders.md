# Reminders

A lightweight, **explicit** reminder system.

Use this when you need the agent to remember something beyond the current task list (for example: “remind me to rotate the API key tomorrow”, or “ask me about deploying before you merge”).

## How to use

- Add a reminder as a checklist item under **Active Reminders**.
- Mark it done when it’s addressed.
- If a reminder becomes urgent or should block work, move it to `interrupt.md` instead.

## Active Reminders

- [ ] [Reminder]
  - Trigger: [next session | before merge | on date YYYY-MM-DD | after X completes]
  - Owner: [human | ai]
  - Notes: [optional]

## Completed

- [x] [Reminder]
  - Completed: [YYYY-MM-DD]
