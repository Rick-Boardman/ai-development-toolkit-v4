# Technical Decisions

This document captures important technical decisions, the context in which they were made, and the reasoning behind them. This helps future developers (and AI assistants) understand why things are the way they are.

## Guidelines for Adding Decisions

**When to document a decision**:

- Architectural changes
- Technology selections
- Pattern adoptions
- Trade-off decisions
- Anything that might be questioned later

**How to document**:

- Provide context (the "why we needed to decide")
- State the decision clearly
- Explain the reasoning
- List alternatives considered
- Note consequences and trade-offs
- Update status if decision changes

**Good decision documentation answers**:

- Why did we choose this approach?
- What alternatives did we consider?
- What trade-offs are we accepting?
- What might we need to revisit later?
